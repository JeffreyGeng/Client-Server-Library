<h1>Server-Client Library</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/VTnZMMkxTxE)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project showcases a server-client architecture. To have persistent data I used MongoDB as my database to save my data so that the server could be turned off and on without losing data. I used Java server and client sockets along with multithreading and proper synchronization techniques so that multiple users could connect to the server and interact with the library. By being careful to synchronize, users could check in/out books and even write reviews and have those changes show up on another user's screen. Finally, I also used JavaFX graphics to create GUIs for the users and included login fields so that accounts could be seperated. I also included a librarian that could have special interactions with the library.
